# Create PR Rule

When the user says "create PR", "make PR", or "generate PR command":

1. First, check the current git status and diff by examining:
   - What files have been changed
   - What branch we're on
   - The nature of the changes (feature, fix, refactor, etc.)

2. Generate a conventional commit style title:
   - feat: for new features
   - fix: for bug fixes
   - refactor: for code refactoring
   - docs: for documentation
   - chore: for maintenance tasks

3. Create a summary that includes:
   - Brief description of what the PR does
   - Key files changed
   - Any breaking changes or notes

4. Output the complete `gh pr create` command:

```bash
gh pr create --title "type: descriptive title" --body "## Summary
Brief description of changes

## Changes
- Change 1
- Change 2

## Testing
- How to test these changes"
```

5. Also show how to push and create in one go if not pushed yet:

```bash
git push -u origin HEAD && gh pr create --title "..." --body "..."
```
